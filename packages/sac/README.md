# Sac ðŸŽ’

[Alban ðŸ”¥] Ever since **jQuery died in hour hearts** we had an idea.

Create a small package that bring together all of our best dark magic art ! ðŸ”®

**_Sac Ã  choses_** is born !

## Installation

```sh
npm i -S @stereorepo/sac
```

## Usage

Sac is composed of two major type of things :

-   Useful functions
-   Components used in every projects

Thus you can import the package in two different ways :

```js
// Using the default import you'll get only the cute useful functions like: query, camelize, supportsWebp, forEach, etc
import sac from '@stereosuper/sac';

// or you can deconstruct sac to get our superComponents
import { query, superWindow } from '@stereosuper/sac';
```
